# First Impressions

- The termination of BChecks on an issue is a problem
- Some of the function documentation is inconsistent (use of `{}`)
- Lack of functions
- How is `differs` implemented?
- Under Scan configuration, "Audit checks - BChecks only" is missing
- They do note that workflow improvements are coming


Is this the Burp extension killer? Absolutely not,
