# First Impressions

## Rough notes
- The termination of BChecks on an issue is a problem
- Some of the function documentation is inconsistent (use of `{}`)
- How is `differs` implemented?
- Under Scan configuration, "Audit checks - BChecks only" is missing
- Cannot find "interesting" responses - only 1:1 comparisons
- Cannot seed with wordlists or other resources
- Passive checks will only run on explicitly scanned targets
- Passive checks do not flag the request/response when a request is used
